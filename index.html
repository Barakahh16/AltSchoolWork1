          <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
          <p>
            My name is Barakat Ayodimeji. I was born and raised in Nigeria. I am
            20 years old and I am currently in my fourth year of university,
            studying Computer Engineering in University of Ilorin, Nigeria. I
            love reading, I love nature and I am a big fan of BTS, the popular
            South Korean boy band. I am a fan of music in general and I spend a
            lot of my time discovering new artists.
          </p>
          <p>
            I applied for Computer Engineering because of the innocent love I
            had for computers-how they work, how they are programmed, I simply
            wanted to know more about them. I'll admit I didn't know what i was
            getting into. It was-is definitely not as easy as I thought and at a
            point, I thought I made a wrong choice(Looking back now, I
            definitely did not)
          </p>
          <p>
            Truly, I started feeling lost in my third year of university as it
            felt like everyone else knew what they were doing while i was still
            struggling with the basics, I tried taking multiple courses but they
            all ended up the same-unfinished. I needed to learn with a proper
            schedule, timeframe and accountability partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found AltSchool in my quest for a program that meets all these
            requirements. Thankfully at the same time, I also found a
            philanthropist that was offering full/half scholarships for women
            interested in the program. This was an opportunity I could not miss.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently juggling university and Altschool, a hard but
            necessary task. Thanks to my line of study, I've found that
            absolutely no knowledge is wasted. The skills I have learnt and I am
            learning at AltSchool makes my school work easier to grasp due to
            similar topics and concepts and vice versa. I no longer feel
            completely lost, I feel like I have finally found a path I walk on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am hopeful that by the end of my AltSchool journey, I would be a
            confident front-end engineer and be able to tackle any project(s)
            assigned to me as well as use my skills to build projects and solve
            problems. I am excited to see what the future holds for me.
